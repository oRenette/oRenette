<h1>Hey there!</h1>

ðŸ‘¨ My name is Owen Renette. I'm in my 3rd year of Software Engineering at Carleton University.

ðŸ’» I enjoy working on just about any project, as once i set my mind on something, I am determined to finish it.
I love space and am deeply facinated with machine learning, and desire to delve deeper into that region of development as my career progresses. Ideally, I find a way to combine the two :)

ðŸŒ³ Outside of programming, I like to play ping-pong, workout, play board games and video games, and go camping.
I also love to watch movies and series when i get the time. My current favorite show is Invinsible (Amazon Prime Video).

<h4>Thanks for sticking around!</h4>
