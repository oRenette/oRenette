<h1>Hey there!</h1>

ðŸ‘¨ My name is Owen Renette. I'm in my 4th year of Software Engineering at Carleton University.

ðŸ’» I enjoy working on just about any project, as once I set my mind on something, I am determined to finish it.
I love space and I am facinated with machine learning, and desire to enter those regions of work as my career progresses. Ideally, I will find a way to combine my two intrests :)

ðŸŒ³ Outside of programming, I like to play ping-pong, workout, play board games and video games, and go camping.
I also love to watch movies and TV series when I get the time.

<h4>Thanks for sticking around!</h4>
